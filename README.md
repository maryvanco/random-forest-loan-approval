# Loan Approval Classification using Random Forest

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a high-accuracy predictive model to predict loan approval decisions using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest. The model leverages feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection to optimize performance. The final model achieved an accuracy of 99.18%, significantly outperforming the baseline Logistic Regression model.

This analysis was part of a larger collaborative project that compared several other machine learning algorithm's ability to classify loan approvals.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset)
